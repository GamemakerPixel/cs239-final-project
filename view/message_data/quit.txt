Thanks for playing!

I hope you see that the point of this game is more than just being a car
insurance company. One somewhat recent addition to data privacy issues our world
faces is that car manufacturers are collecting data about their customers
driving habits, from the cars *they* paid for, and selling it to their
customers' car insurance providers.

While you may say "Well, I'm a good driver, why should I care?" I'd urge you to
consider the precident that it sets when companies are allowed to collect and
sell data about you, without your consent, from the devices you bought and paid
for. I hope you consider the ethical implications of such a policy.

Thank you again for your time and consideration,

Aidan Bensch
