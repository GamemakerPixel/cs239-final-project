You are the CEO of a car insurance company. Your goal is
to accumulate $10,000,000. You begin with $100,000 and
3 customers. Each day you will gain a new customer, who
will pay $2000 upfront and start with a daily fee of $100.
Some customers are better at driving than others, and you
can change their daily rates anywhere between $50-$750 a
day. Beware however, customers will leave if they think
their rate is too high for how they drive. Additionally,
every day, each customer has a chance to get in a small
crash, costing you anywhere between $500-$2,000, or worse,
a large crash, costing you between $5,000-$10,000. Luckily
for you, car manufacturers who sell cars to your customers
have started collecting personal data about their driving
abilities and are willing to sell it to you at a rate of
$500 per customer.

Good luck out there!
